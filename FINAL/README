JULIA YOO's PORTFOLIO WEBSITE 

Author: Julia Yoo 
Date: January 2025
This is my portfolio site showcasing all my coding based work. 
It is built with HTML/CSS, Javascript, Three.js, Firebase, GSAP, HTML2CANVAS and Opensheet.

Domain is not yet transferred. 

index.html/script.js

These files build and power the home page, which features 7 visual elements, 2D and 3D
that make up a face. Each has an on-click interaction, displaying one project each. 
The nose follows mouse position. 

about.html

This file builds the about page, which includes a blurb and contact info. 
The page uses GSAP to feature a spinning scroll triggered face.

game.html/game.js

These files build and power the game function, which is a simple javascript collage
maker. User clicks stickers to pick up and place. Then the user can post to gallery,
powered by Firebase and html2canvas.

gallery.html

This file powers the gallery tab, only accesible via game. The gallery displays all 
the collages stored in the firebase database. 

cv.html/cv.js

These files build and power the cv page. The cv page is powered by Opensheet and 
references a Google Sheet to write out CV qualifications remotely.

styles.css

styles contains all of the universal style rules for the site.
